'''
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. 
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters 
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
